# MD_AButton

Small library to handle the analog keys that come on an LCD shield. 

Implements debouncing and auto repeat of keys with configurable timing. Extensible to multiple buttons/switches.

Shyuld work for most standard sheilds. If the analog values are different they can be calibrated using a utility to define the analog values returned for each switch press.
